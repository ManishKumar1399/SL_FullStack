Session Tracking -> Cookie
	1. login form -> action -> loginServlet -> com.simplilearn.LoginServlet
		-> username  :- raghav
		-> login
	2. LoginServlet -> set the cookie
			-> username, set cookie -> userId -> username(raghav)
			-> sendRedirect("/dashboard"); -> com.simplilearn.AccountDashboard
	3. AccountDashboard -> extract the cookie
		-> userId, value
		-> if present
				-> UserId read from cookie :- raghav
			else
				-> No UserId cookie was found

Communication between Client and Server :-
	Browser -> request -> Application Server
										servlet(LoginServlet set the cookie(userId))-> dashboard (cookie validation happens)
	Browser <- response + cookie <- server response along with cookie
